## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pandilladeduendes
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

No external dependencies are required - the system uses only Python standard library.

## Usage

Run the main application and navigate through the menu system:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Main Menu Options:
1. **Product Management** - Manage your inventory
2. **Customer Management** - Manage customer information
3. **Order Management** - Create and manage sales orders
4. **Reports** - View business reports and analytics
5. **Exit** - Close the application

### Data Storage

The system uses JSON files for data persistence:
- `data/products.json` - Product inventory data
- `data/customers.json` - Customer information
- `data/orders.json` - Sales order data

Data files are created automatically when you first run the application.

## Example Workflow

1. **Add Products**: Start by adding products to your inventory
   - Set product ID, name, description, price, and initial stock

2. **Add Customers**: Create customer records
   - Store customer ID, name, email, and optional phone/address

3. **Create Orders**: Process sales orders
   - Create order for a customer
   - Add products to the order
   - Complete the order (automatically deducts inventory)

4. **Monitor Business**: Use reports to track
   - Inventory levels and low stock alerts
   - Sales performance and revenue
   - Customer metrics

## File Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ models.py        # Data models (Product, Customer, Order)
â”œâ”€â”€ storage.py       # JSON-based data persistence
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory.py     # Product inventory management
â”œâ”€â”€ customers.py     # Customer management
â”œâ”€â”€ orders.py        # Order processing and management

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ customers.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ orders.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Key Classes

- **Product**: Represents inventory items with pricing and stock tracking
- **Customer**: Stores customer contact and identification information
- **Order/OrderItem**: Manages sales transactions and line items
- **InventoryManager**: Handles product operations and stock management
- **CustomerManager**: Manages customer CRUD operations
- **OrderManager**: Processes orders and coordinates with inventory
- **DataStorage**: Provides JSON-based persistence layer

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required

## Data Validation

The system includes built-in validation:
- Stock levels cannot go negative
- Orders can only be completed if sufficient inventory exists
- Customer and product IDs must be unique
- Required fields are validated during data entry

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system:
- Web-based user interface
- Database integration (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- User authentication and authorization
- Multi-location inventory tracking
- Barcode scanning support
- Email notifications
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Import/export functionality
